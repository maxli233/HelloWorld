<p>The first version of HTML was created in the year 1991. It is a worldwide language we use for creating a web page. HTML is made of different elements which can tell the web browsers how to display the content.   </p>

<p>	I think this class, Web Page Design, would help me later in life and give me an idea about what coding is. I am taking Introduction to Computer Programming next semester. I may choose Computer science as my major in college. So I want to see if I like computer stuff or not, then I can decide on my major.  	</p>
